# Bayesian-optimization-based-hyperparameters-tuning-for-a-neural-network

A bayesian optimization based hyperparameter tuning of a neural network has been performed in this code. Following hyperparameters have been tuned:

1. Number of layers in a neural network
2. Number of neurons in each neural network
3. Activation functions for each layer of neurons
4. Dropout regularization rate
5. Momentum
6. Optimizer
7. Batch size

This code is quite generic. You can use it with any dataset after making some basic changes.
